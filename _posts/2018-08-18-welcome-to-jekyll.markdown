Trying out GitHub Pages with Jekyll to host a static site.

- installed Ruby and Jekyll
- generated a Jekyll site and pushed it to my GitHub Pages [repo](https://github.com/alex9311/alex9311.github.io)
- used [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) to register alexandersimes.com ($8 for a year)
- set the Host Records in Namecheap to point to my GitHub Pages domain ([tutorial](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages))
- set GitHub Pages up with a custom domain ([tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/))

Thats all! Took about 30 minutes to get it all working plus a bit of wait time for the DNS server to update.
